# TODO
- integrate the reinforce algorithm with the saturation algorithm
- define new queues / heuristics
	- similarity to conjecture
- extract more proof state features
- investigate why some problems from ALG cannot be parsed in a finite time
- parallel processing -- multiple problems (= episodes) run at once

# DONE
- implement policy network
- implement the reinforce algorithm
- implement heuristic using the policy network

# IDEAS
- normalization of the proof state vector
- reward based on whether the chosen queue picked a clause which ended up in
  the proof
